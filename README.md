# Roguelike
This is a simple graphical roguelike that uses PyGame. This project is a refresher for me on Python and PyGame.

Kill enemies to level up and get random equipment as you traverse through the game. <br/>
You have 3 basic attributes that will have random boosts everytime you start the game:
- Health
- Defense
- Damage
<br/>
Move with WASD and your mouse.

## To-Do
- Player movement
- Enemies
